# Product Documentation Constitution

These are the **non-negotiable principles** that govern all product documentation created with this skill. These principles apply regardless of language, workflow type (full or quick), or document format.

Always use the language of the user interaction to create the final files, including headings and default content of templates. If the user explicitly requests a different language, use it.

---

## Core Principles

### I. User Value First

**Principle**: Every piece of work must clearly articulate value to end users.

**What This Means**:
- Every requirement in a PRD must explain how it helps users
- Every epic in a Plan must state user benefit
- Every user story must follow "As a [user], I want [capability], so that [benefit]"
- Even technical tasks must explain indirect user value

**Why It Matters**:
Without clear user value, teams build features nobody needs. This principle keeps everyone focused on outcomes, not outputs.

**Validation Questions**:
- Who benefits from this?
- What problem does this solve for them?
- How will their life/work be better?
- Would users pay for this?

**Examples**:

✅ **Good**:
- "As a customer support agent, I want to see customer purchase history, so that I can resolve issues faster without asking repetitive questions."
- "Migrate to PostgreSQL 15 to enable faster query performance, reducing dashboard load times from 5s to <1s, improving analyst productivity."

❌ **Bad**:
- "As a user, I want a button"
- "Implement caching" (no user value explained)
- "Refactor authentication module" (technical work without user impact)

**Application to Workflows**:
- **PRDs**: Every requirement must state user value
- **Plans**: Every epic must articulate user benefit
- **Stories**: Must use proper user story format with "so that" benefit clause
- **Quick Stories**: Same requirement as full stories
- **Technical Tasks**: Must explain how this enables/improves user experience
- **Bugs**: Impact on users must be documented
- **Spikes**: Must connect research to user-facing decision

---

### II. Testable Criteria

**Principle**: All success criteria and acceptance criteria must be objective and verifiable.

**What This Means**:
- Use concrete, measurable language
- Avoid subjective terms: "intuitive", "easy", "fast", "simple"
- Use specific metrics: "<200ms response time", "95% of users complete flow", "5/5 CSAT score"
- Acceptance criteria must have clear pass/fail states
- Use GIVEN-WHEN-THEN format for clarity

**Why It Matters**:
Vague criteria lead to endless debates about "done". Testable criteria create shared understanding and enable objective validation.

**Validation Questions**:
- How will we know if this is working?
- What specific metric will we measure?
- Can a QA engineer test this without ambiguity?
- Would two people agree on whether this is met?

**Examples**:

✅ **Good**:
- "Response time < 200ms for 95th percentile"
- "GIVEN user is on checkout page WHEN they click 'Pay' THEN payment processes and confirmation appears within 3 seconds"
- "95% of users complete onboarding flow in < 5 minutes"
- "Zero crashes reported in production for 30 days"

❌ **Bad**:
- "System should be fast"
- "UI should be intuitive"
- "Users should easily find features"
- "Performance should be good"
- "Should work well on mobile"

**Application to Workflows**:
- **PRDs**: Success metrics must be specific and measurable
- **Plans**: Each epic must have quantifiable success criteria
- **Stories**: Acceptance criteria must be objective, use GIVEN-WHEN-THEN
- **Quick Stories**: Same standard as full stories
- **Technical Tasks**: Define concrete deliverables and success criteria
- **Bugs**: Expected behavior must be specific
- **Spikes**: Define what specific question will be answered

### III. Complete Context

**Principle**: Each document must be understandable on its own, without requiring tribal knowledge.

**What This Means**:
- Include all necessary background
- Define abbreviations and jargon on first use
- Link to related documents
- Explain "why" decisions were made
- Document assumptions
- Don't assume everyone was in the meeting

**Why It Matters**:
People join teams, context gets lost, memories fade. Self-contained documents ensure everyone can contribute regardless of when they joined.

**Validation Questions**:
- Could a new team member understand this?
- Are all abbreviations defined?
- Is the "why" explained?
- Are related docs linked?
- Would this make sense in 6 months?

**Examples**:

✅ **Good**:
- "We're building email notifications because 73% of users reported missing important updates (see user research doc). This feature will address the #1 user complaint from Q3 surveys."
- "API (Application Programming Interface) latency must be < 200ms because our SLA (Service Level Agreement) commits to sub-second response times."

❌ **Bad**:
- "Per the meeting, we're doing notifications"
- "Because Bob said so"
- "Everyone knows why this is important"
- References to discussions without links or summaries
- Unexplained technical decisions

**Application to Workflows**:
- **PRDs**: Include problem context, why now, related initiatives
- **Plans**: Reference PRD, explain phasing decisions
- **Stories**: Include background, fit in epic context
- **Quick Stories**: Provide enough context to execute without asking questions
- **Quick Bugs**: Document environment, steps, expected behavior
- **Quick Tasks**: Explain why this work matters

---

### IV. Prioritized Work

**Principle**: Every piece of work must have a clear priority and realistic effort estimate.

**What This Means**:
- Use consistent priority framework (Critical/High/Medium/Low or P0/P1/P2)
- Priority should reflect business/user impact
- Estimates should be relative and realistic
- Dependencies must be explicit
- Work should be sequenced logically

**Why It Matters**:
Without priorities, teams thrash. With priorities, teams execute efficiently and deliver maximum value.

**Validation Questions**:
- What happens if we don't do this?
- What gets blocked if this isn't done?
- How does this compare to other work?
- Is the estimate realistic given team capacity?
- What are the dependencies?

**Examples**:

✅ **Good**:
- "P0 (Critical): Payment processing broken - revenue impact, affects all users"
- "P1 (High): Mobile responsive layout - 40% of users on mobile, workaround exists"
- "P2 (Medium): Dark mode - requested by 15% of users, no business impact"
- "Estimate: M (3-5 days) based on similar work last quarter"

❌ **Bad**:
- "Everything is P0"
- "This is important" (relative to what?)
- "Should be quick" (how quick?)
- No estimate provided
- Estimate: "As fast as possible"

**Application to Workflows**:
- **PRDs**: Requirements must be P0/P1/P2
- **Plans**: Epics must be sequenced with rationale
- **Stories**: Priority + estimate required
- **Quick Stories**: Priority + estimate required
- **Quick Bugs**: Severity + Priority + estimate for fix
- **Quick Tasks**: Priority with business justification
- **Quick Spikes**: Time-box mandatory (2-8 hours typical, max 2 days)

### V. Consistent Terminology

**Principle**: Use the same terms for the same concepts across all documentation.

**What This Means**:
- Pick one term and stick with it
- Create a glossary for key concepts
- Don't use synonyms for core entities
- Align terminology across PRD → Plan → Stories
- Use industry-standard terms when applicable

**Why It Matters**:
Inconsistent terminology creates confusion. "Customer" vs "User" vs "Client" - are these the same? Different? Nobody knows, so everyone wastes time clarifying.

**Validation Questions**:
- Are we using the same term we used in the PRD?
- Do we have multiple terms for the same thing?
- Would a new team member be confused?
- Is there a glossary if terms are complex?

**Examples**:

✅ **Good**:
- **Consistent**: Always use "workspace" (not sometimes "space", "area", "room")
- **Glossary**: "Workspace: a collaborative area where team members share documents"
- **Standard Terms**: Use industry terms like "API", "SaaS", "MRR"

❌ **Bad**:
- **Inconsistent**: "workspace" in PRD, "space" in Plan, "room" in stories
- **Made-up Terms**: "doohickey" instead of standard "widget"
- **Undefined Jargon**: Using company-specific abbreviations without definition

**Application to Workflows**:
- **PRDs**: Define key terms in glossary
- **Plans**: Use exact terms from PRD
- **Stories**: Match terminology from PRD and Plan
- **Quick Issues**: Use established terminology or define new terms

## Principle Application by Workflow

### Full Workflow (PRD → Plan → Stories)

All five principles apply strictly:
1. ✅ User value in every requirement, epic, story
2. ✅ Testable metrics and acceptance criteria
3. ✅ Complete context in each document
4. ✅ Clear priorities and sequencing
5. ✅ Consistent terminology across all docs


## Enforcement

### How Principles Are Enforced

**During Creation**:
- Skill actively checks for principle violations
- Missing elements trigger questions to user
- Templates include principle reminders

**During Review**:
- Checklist includes constitution validation
- Analyze workflow cross-checks principles
- Non-compliance is flagged before finalization

**Error Messages**:

If principle violated, skill responds:

**Principle I (User Value)**:
```
⚠️ Constitution Violation: User Value First

This [story/requirement/epic] doesn't clearly articulate user value.

Current: "[current text]"

Required: Explain WHO benefits and HOW their life/work improves.

Question: How will users benefit from this specifically?
```

**Principle II (Testable Criteria)**:
```
⚠️ Constitution Violation: Testable Criteria

This acceptance criterion uses vague language: "[vague term]"

Vague terms like "fast", "easy", "intuitive" are not testable.

Required: Use specific, measurable criteria.

Example:
❌ "System should be fast"
✅ "API response time < 200ms for 95th percentile"

Can you provide a specific, measurable criterion?
```

**Principle III (Complete Context)**:
```
⚠️ Constitution Violation: Complete Context

This document references "[undefined term/abbreviation]" without definition.

Required: Define all abbreviations and provide context.

Question: Can you explain what "[term]" means?
```

**Principle IV (Prioritized Work)**:
```
⚠️ Constitution Violation: Prioritized Work

This [item] is missing [priority/estimate].

Required: All work must have priority and realistic estimate.

Question: What's the priority and estimated effort?
```

**Principle V (Consistent Terminology)**:
```
⚠️ Constitution Violation: Consistent Terminology

You're using "[term1]" here but used "[term2]" in [previous doc].

Are these the same concept?

Required: Use consistent terminology across all documents.

Question: Which term should we use consistently?
```

## Exceptions

### When Principles Can Be Relaxed

**NEVER**: Principles I (User Value) and II (Testable Criteria) cannot be waived.

**RARELY**: Principles III, IV, V can be temporarily relaxed only when:
- User explicitly requests quick draft
- Document is marked "DRAFT - INCOMPLETE"
- Clear plan exists to complete before finalization

**NEVER SHIP**: Documentation violating principles should not be used for:
- Stakeholder reviews
- Development sprint planning
- Team execution
- External communication
